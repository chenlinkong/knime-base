    <shortDescription>Node collecting variables created in a loop.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Node collecting variables created in a loop. This node closes a 
			loop but does not aggregate data created in the loop but only 
			variables. It can be used to close loops where all the magic 
			happens in the loop itself and no aggregated output is needed. One 
			instance could be a loop over a list of files, whereby each file 
			is processed in one loop iteration (including writing one output 
			file for each input).

		<option name="Variable selection">
			The variables that will be collected and put into the output table.

		<option name="Propagate modified loop variables">
			If checked, variables whose values are modified within the loop are exported by this node. These variables
			must be declared outside the loop, i.e. injected into the loop from a side-branch or be available upstream
			of the corresponding loop start node. For the latter, any modification of a variable is passed back to the 
			start node in subsequent iterations (e.g. moving sum calculation). Note that variables defined by the loop 
			start node itself are excluded as these usually represent loop controls (e.g. <i>"currentIteration"</i>).
